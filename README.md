# CoordConv Implenmentation
Original Paper: [An Intriguing Failing of Convolutional Neural Networks and the CoordConv Solution][original paper]

*This repository is not from the authors of the paper...*

[original paper]: http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03247

## Tensorflow
The tensorflow implementation is copied from S8 in [the original paper][original paper]. And moditied to support 2D conv when height and width are not same.

## Pytorch
Translated from the original tensorflow code.

## TODO
- [ ] support Conv1d for nlp tasks
